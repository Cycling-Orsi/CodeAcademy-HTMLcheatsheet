# CodeAcademy-HTMLcheatsheet
My first real Code Academy project to create my own cheatsheet for HTML topics. I chose the topic of semantic HTML. 
I just got started with learning HTML/CSS, so any pointers you have will help. I have been struggling specifically with positioning elements on the webpage using CSS, so any pointers on this would be especially helpful. The navbar and footer elements were particularly frustrating. 
Thanks!
